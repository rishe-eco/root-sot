# STATE — imnstr / 01-website

*Newest block first. Written by `handoff`.*

## 2026-10-10 · `lifecycle-trial/imnstr` @ d8245d0 (+ step 1, third pass, fresh)

**Lanes in flight:** none.

**Next steps, in order**
1. Step 2, Spec (`spec full`, Opus · high): read `00-intake.md`, then `01-research.md` (summary, then §5–§6). In the one batch of questions, ask: admin shape A / B / B′ / C (research §5); entry fields (title? tags? prompt wording that invites explaining, §2.1); can entries be edited or unpublished without trace (§2.4); podcast: one link or several per episode, and the empty state if no episodes exist yet (§4); a dated "now" line on the landing page, yes or no (§3, mind §2.2); the drop review: the private question at 3 and 6 months (§6).
2. Steps 3a/3b journeys, then 4 wireframes, 4b Claude Design. Step 6 can run beside 3–5.

**Carry-overs**
- `01-research.md` was redone fresh at the founder's request. Both 2026-10-09 passes and their logs are in `lifecycle/trial-run/archive/01-research/` for the final review. **The two blocks below are stale on research findings.**
- Hard lines: no streaks, counters or gap markers on the site; the log publishes what was learned, never public plans.
- If shape A: the security floor in research §5 becomes acceptance criteria, and auth gets its own build stage.
- IMNSTR is outside Root: no pillar, no OST, no Root brand. Design system from 4b. Code repo needed by step 7.

**Questions for the founder:** the six in next step 1 (for spec).

**Owed:** nothing.

**Lanes in flight:** none.

**Next steps, in order**
1. Step 2, Spec (`spec full`, Opus · high): read `00-intake.md`, then `01-research.md` (summary, then §4–§5). In the one batch of questions, ask: admin shape A / B / C / D (research §4); entry titles, tags, shown date; one link or several per podcast episode; how "still of use" is measured privately and over what period (research §2: not before ~2–3 months).
2. Steps 3a/3b journeys, then 4 wireframes, 4b Claude Design. Step 6 can run beside 3–5.

**Carry-overs**
- `01-research.md` was redone on Opus and supersedes the morning's Sonnet pass; the block below is out of date on research findings.
- Hard lines from research: no streaks, counters or gap markers on the site; the log records what was learned, not public intentions.
- If shape A: passkeys (two devices), per-account throttling, `__Host-` Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=Strict cookies, no tokens in localStorage (OWASP). Auth is the risk stage.
- Not researched (network): `/now` pages, Cloudflare Access limits, Decap backends.
- IMNSTR is outside Root: no pillar, no OST, no Root brand. Design system from 4b. Code repo needed by step 7.

**Questions for the founder:** the four in next step 1 (for spec).

**Owed:** nothing.

## 2026-10-09 · `lifecycle-trial/imnstr` @ b3155c5 (+ step 1)

**Lanes in flight:** none.

**Next steps, in order**
1. Step 2, Spec (`spec full`, Opus · high): read `00-intake.md`, `01-research.md`. Ask clarifying questions in one batch. Decide admin shape A (live login) vs B (files in git); define "still of use" (intake §6) as the founder's own measure.
2. Steps 3a/3b journeys, then 4 wireframes, 4b Claude Design.

**Carry-overs**
- Research found nothing in Root's evidence summary beyond self-tracking: no streaks, counters or visible stats on the log; a gap must not be punished.
- Cloudflare Access was not researched (no sources); passkey leaning is blog-grade evidence, check against the WebAuthn spec before the build plan.
- IMNSTR is outside Root: no pillar, no OST entry, no Root brand. Design system comes from 4b.
- Code repo doesn't exist; needed by step 7.

**Questions for the founder:** admin as live login (A) or files in git (B)? (for spec)

**Owed:** nothing.

## 2026-10-09 · `lifecycle-trial/imnstr` @ 5c13321 (+ step 0)

**Lanes in flight:** none.

**Next steps, in order**
1. Step 1, Research (`research`, Opus · high): read `00-intake.md` and `ecosystem/canon/04-research/00-evidence-summary.md` first. Scope is narrow: comparable personal learning-log and podcast-link sites; how a one-user admin is best secured and kept simple.
2. Step 2, Spec (`spec full`, Opus · high): turn the drop rule ("no more use for it") into something testable.

**Carry-overs**
- IMNSTR is outside Root: no pillar, no OST entry, no Root brand. Design system comes from step 4b (Claude Design), not Root's tokens.
- The founder finishes design in Claude Design after wireframes; steps 5 and 9 review against that output.
- Code repo doesn't exist; needed by step 7.
- Out of scope in v1: per-project pages, projects page, comments, visitor accounts, search, analytics, newsletter, audio hosting.

**Questions for the founder:** none open.

**Owed:** nothing.
